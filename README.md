Online Browser Multiplayer Pong 

## Development
From project root:

* Install dependencies with `yarn install`
* In terminal window-1 start client watch & build with `yarn dev-client`
* In terminal window-2 start server watch & build with `yarn dev-server`

Server will restart itself but clients have to be refreshed manually from browser for now.
